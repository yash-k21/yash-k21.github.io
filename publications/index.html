For the identification, we use a novel instrument based on the political competition within county and it’s effect on the volume of federal aid distribution, especially when disaster occurs closer to the election. Due to the winner-takes-all nature of the US election, we argue that in non-swing states, politicians in the swing counties have no incentive to perform any better, and thus political competitiveness affects GDP only through federal aid. We find that a 1% increase in disaster aid results in a 0.03% increase in local GDP for the next year. With respect to the literature on political competition, we found evidence that political competition within a county is positively associated with 1) higher volume of disaster aid in non-swing states and 2) higher GDP growth rate in swing states.</p> </div> <div class="bibtex hidden"> <figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-bibtex" data-lang="bibtex"><span class="nc">@article</span><span class="p">{</span><span class="nl">politicsDisasterAid</span><span class="p">,</span>
